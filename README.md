# Write Some Code

## What to expect

In this excercise, you will write a program. That's it.

- You choose the language and editor
- You decide how to verify that it works
- You can use technical references for your language, libraries, etc
- You _cannot_ look up how to implement the algorithm
- You _cannot_ use a library or language feature that already implements the algorithm

## The problem

### Input

Input to your program is a possibly empty sequence of integers, in some data
structure convenient to your language and library choices. The sequence is not
ordered and it might contain multiple integers with the same values. You will
never receive a non-integer so your program does not need to guard against invalid
input.

For example, **8, 2, 5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 5, 4, 4, 7** .

### Output

Output from your program is also a sequence of inegers.

### Behavior

Your program must remove all duplicates but otherwise retain the original order of
the sequence.  For the example, the  output sequence corresponding to the example input
is **8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 7** .
